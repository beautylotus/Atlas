# Notice Guys

- Do not to deploy it now !!
- It's incomplete so it will not connect now !!
- I will update it time to time !!
- You can `Fork` it to make a copy and commit changes inside your copy !!
- Note: copy pasting old Miku Bot commands will not work here. We have to redisign all commands. For a structural rederence checkout [KILLUA bot](https://github.com/zhwzein/Killua-Zoldyck). We are goint to make something that is same in structure like Killua.
- Do not copy paste from other bot. This bot will have our own script.
